## Issues found

1. Undefined Variable Reference
    ```
    if (lhsPriority > -99)
    ```
    lhsPriority is undefined - should be balancePriority. This will cause a runtime error.

2. Inverted Filter Logic
    The filter condition is backwards:
    ```
    if (balance.amount <= 0) {
        return true; // Keeps balances with 0 or negative amounts
    }
    ```
    This filters OUT positive balances and keeps zero/negative ones, which is likely unintended.

3. Incomplete Sort Comparison
    ```
        if (leftPriority > rightPriority) {
            return -1;
        } else if (rightPriority > leftPriority) {
            return 1;
        }
        // Missing return 0 for equal priorities
    ```

4. Missing useMemo Dependencies
    ```
        }, [balances, prices]);
    ```
    prices is used in the dependency array but not in the memoized computation, while getPriority function (used inside) isn't memoized.

5. Double Array Processing
    ```
        const formattedBalances = sortedBalances.map(...) // First map
        const rows = sortedBalances.map(...) // Second map on same data
    ```
    Two separate mapping operations instead of one combined operation.

6. Array Index as React Key
    ```
        key={index}
    ```
    Using array index as key can cause rendering issues when the list order changes.

7. Function Defined Inside Component
    ```
        const getPriority = (blockchain: any): number => {
    ```
    This function is recreated on every render, causing unnecessary re-computations.

8. Type Issues
    `getPriority` uses any type instead of proper typing
    `WalletBalance` interface lacks blockchain property that's being used
    Wrong type annotation in rows mapping (`FormattedWalletBalance` vs actual type)

### Key Improvements Made
#### Correctness Fixes:

- Fixed undefined lhsPriority variable
- Corrected filter logic to keep positive balances
- Added missing return case in sort comparison
- Fixed TypeScript types and interfaces

#### Performance Optimizations:

- Combined filtering, sorting, and formatting into single memoized operation
- Moved getPriority outside component and used lookup object
- Used stable, unique keys for React elements
- Proper dependency array for useMemo

#### Code Quality:

- Better type safety with proper interfaces
- More maintainable priority system using lookup object
- Clearer variable names and logic flow
- Added precision to number formatting
